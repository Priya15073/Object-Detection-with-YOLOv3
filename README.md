# Object-Detection-with-YOLOv3
This project : <br />
1.Performs real-time object detection with YOLOv3  <br />
2.Uses OpenCV to manipulate video data <br />
3.Uses pre-trained models to perform real-time and passive inference with/without a GPU <br />
4.Develops a simple command line application with Python for inference  which saves output as a .mp4 file(yolo_utils.py) <br />
<br />
Download pretrained yolov3 weights- $wget https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights  <br />
Download pretrained yolov3-tiny weights- $wget https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3-tiny.weights <br />
Use darknet directory: git clone https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet<br />
<br />
Note:Output sample image for yolov3 and yolov3 tiny are uploaded <br />
